The way I like to learn is that when I am starting point to learn something 
I like to go over a YouTube video teach on learning something 
 say this one for example claims to be teaching on js after I have completed
 this video, I will head over to the Odin project and cover the course with this I a
able to know how to apply some content and when they say of something like variable 
am able to relate when and where I can use variables.
 lets its I consider this a great way of learning since I learn from 
 project tailored courses and Following a course such Odin I able to 
point out what I could have missed and the areas I need to do more research
